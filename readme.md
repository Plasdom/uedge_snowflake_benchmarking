This repo contains UEDGE case files for a set of cases covering each possible snowflake topology.

The grids are generated using INGRID (https://github.com/LLNL/INGRID). The magnetic equilibria come from the analytic solution to the vacuum poloidal field around three current filaments. 

Each mirrored pair of snowflake topologies (SF15/165, SF45/135 and SF75/105) are generated with the same grid settings. The UEDGE settings are also the same, accounting for the mirroring, so that it can be verified that UEDGE is treating these cases the same numerically.
